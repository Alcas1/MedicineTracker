# MedicineTracker

A Medicine tracker app frontend that allows users to track and add medicine that needs to be taken. No Server Side, data is stored purely in JSON with localStorage. Jquery, JS for data handling. Written in 5 hours at a hackathon after a company asked me to make them a basic medicine tracker app.
